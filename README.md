Employee Attendance Tracker
This is a personal project I built from scratch using a full-stack setup with a custom backend and a modern frontend.

Project Overview
This application helps track employee attendance efficiently. It supports simple authentication, real-time updates, and a responsive UI.

Project Structure
The frontend code is located in the app directory and was built using Vite.

The backend code is located in the convex directory, which I customized to handle real-time data and user sessions.

Running npm run dev starts both the frontend and backend development servers.

App Authentication
The app includes built-in anonymous authentication for quick and easy access during development. This can be replaced with more secure methods in production if needed.

Developing and Deploying
I developed and structured this app with performance and scalability in mind. Everything, from routing to backend data handling, is built and maintained by me.

If you're looking to extend or deploy this app, feel free to explore the codebase. I kept the structure clean and well-documented for future improvements and scalability.
